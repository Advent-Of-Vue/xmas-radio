[Advent Of Vue](https://adventofvue.com) is a series of 24 Vue coding challenges that are sent out every day from December 1 to December 24 via [a dedicated newsletter](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/AdventOfVue). If you'd like to receive more of these puzzles in the future, go ahead and sign up!

## Problem description

'Tis the season for Christmas music! Unfortunately, the grumpy ol' grinch has snuck in and stolen some code from our festive Christmas radio.

The looted code used to live in `composables/useCurrentTrack.vue` and was centered around interacting with the [useMediaControls](https://vueuse.org/core/usemediacontrols/#usemediacontrols) composable from [VueUse](https://vueuse.org/).

Fill in the missing code (marked with `//greasy grinch footprints!`) to get the radio working again.

If you're up for a super tricky but entertaining challege, wipe out app.vue completely and come up with a Christmas Radio of your own!
